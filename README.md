## ```models```
This is where we hold files for truck models.

## ```final_blindspot```
This is where the code for the final blindspot computation lives. More information can be found in the ReadME in that directory.

## ```scripts```
This is a pool of experimental scripts we had to build out the project. This is not instrumental to the final project, but is documented to demonstrate what specific lines of code do.

## ```starter_project```
This is the folder where we will build out our starter projects, and this was for internal use. Each SWE can structure this however they choose to. This is not related to the final product.
